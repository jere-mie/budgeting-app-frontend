# budgeting-app-frontend

## Dev requirements
- Node v16.15.1 (if you have nvm, simply run `nvm use`)
- npm v8.11.0 (probably doesn't matter)

Q. Why do we need a specific node version?
A. Because expo only works for specific node versions.

## Dev setup
1. Clone this repo and cd into it.
2. Install node_modules with `npm install`
3. Start dev server with `npm start`
